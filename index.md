# What is Stakz?

Ever been browsing some documentation with several copy paste steps?

Ever wish building a basic form felt more like a python notebook and less like
importing an airplane to get a chair? (Seriously why do we need to know the latest Javascript framework
just to do something simple!?)

Wish embedding widgets into documentation was as simple as:

`<field label="hello" description="this binds to the hello variable">World</field>`
<field label="hello" description="this binds to the hello variable">World</field>

...and that using that variable in a script was as simple as:


`<script> return "echo " + hello </script>`
<script> return "echo " + hello </script>
